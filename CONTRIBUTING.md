<p align="center">⚠️ To anyone who wants to contribute to this project : please note that PR for typos, grammar, misspelled words in documentation/README.md and code not really contributing to the project won't be taken into account anymore and will be rejected as there's way too much of them. ⚠️
  <br />
  <br />I'm bad at writing a fluent and correct English : deal with it ! 
</p>

To say it another way : all contributions (even the smallest ones) are welcomed and will be happily reviewed, as long as they have other purpose than boost your stats for Hacktoberfest by correcting typos, deleting supernumerary spaces in code, reformating text, adding unnecessary documentation or code, etc

# How to contribute
*To avoid working for nothing, you should really submit a discussion or an issue (if you want to correct a bug) explaining why you want to contribute and what is your proposal of contribution.*

   1. Fork the repo
   2. Create a new branch in the forked repo
   3. Do your modifications to the code
   4. **Test** and **verify** your code
   5. Push a pull request to the original repo
   6. Wait for the code review (generally in less than a day)
